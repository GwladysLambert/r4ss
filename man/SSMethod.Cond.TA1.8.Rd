\description{
Uses method TA1.8 (described in Appendix A of Francis 2011) to do
stage-2 weighting of composition data from a Stock Synthesis model.
Outputs a mutiplier, w (with bootstrap 95% confidence interval),
so that N2y = w x N1y, where N1y and N2y are the stage-1 and stage-2
multinomial sample sizes for the data set in year y.  Optionally
makes a plot of observed (with confidence limits, based on N1y)
and expected mean lengths (or ages).
\cr\cr
CAUTIONARY/EXPLANATORY NOTE.
The large number of options available in SS makes it very
difficult to be sure that what this function does is
appropriate for all combinations of options.  The following
notes might help anyone wanting to check or correct the code.
1. The code first takes the appropriate database (lendbase, sizedbase,
   agedbase, or condbase) and removes un-needed rows.
2. The remaining rows of the database are grouped into individual
   comps (indexed by vector indx) and relevant statistics (e.g.,
   observed and expected mean length or age), and ancillary data,
   are calculated for each comp (these are stored in pldat - one row
   per comp).
3. If the data are to be plotted, the comps are grouped, with each
   group corresponding to a panel in the plot, and groups are indexed
   by plindx.
4. A single multiplier is calculated to apply to all the comps.

\description{
Uses an extension of method TA1.8 (described in Appendix A of Francis 2011)
to do stage-2 weighting of conditional age at length composition data from a
Stock Synthesis model. Outputs two versions (A and B) of a mutiplier, \emph{w},
(with bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals) so that
\emph{N2i} = \emph{w} x \emph{N1i},
where \emph{N1i} and \emph{N2i} are the stage-1 and stage-2 multinomial
sample sizes for the \emph{i}th composition. Optionally makes a plot
(for version A) of observed and expected mean ages, with two alternative
sets of confidence limits - based on \emph{N1i} (thin lines) and \emph{N2i}
(thick lines) - for the observed values.\cr
\cr
The two versions of w differ according to whether the calculated mean ages are
indexed by year (version A) or by year and length bin (version B).  Version A is
recommended; version B is included for historical reasons.\cr
\cr
CAUTIONARY/EXPLANATORY NOTE. The large number of options available in SS makes it
very difficult to be sure that what this function does is appropriate for all
combinations of options. The following notes (for version A) might help anyone
wanting to check or correct the code.
\enumerate{
  \item The code first removes un-needed rows
from database condbase.
  \item The remaining rows of the database are grouped
(indexed by vector indx) and relevant statistics (e.g., observed and expected
mean age), and ancillary data, are calculated for each group (these are stored
in pldat - one row per group).
  \item If the data are to be plotted they are further
grouped by fleet, with one panel of the plot per fleet.
  \item A single multiplier, \emph{w}, is calculated to apply to all the
selected data.
