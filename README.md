### R code for Stock Synthesis

Stock Synthesis is a fisheries stock assessment model written in ADMB by Dr. Rick Methot at the [NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center](http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/). The R code in the r4ss package is based on the original work of Dr. Ian Stewart begun around 2005 and released as an open source R package on CRAN in 2009. The package has benefited from contributions, suggestions, and bug reports from many collaborators and users.

*Code available on this website comes with no warranty or guarantee of accuracy. It merely represents an ongoing attempt to integrate output plotting, statistics and diagnostics. It is absolutely necessary that prior to use with a new application, the user checks the output manually to verify that there are no plotting or statistical bugs which could incorrectly represent the output files being analyzed.*
